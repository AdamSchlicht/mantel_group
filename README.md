# Mantel Group Programming Task

My program, solution.py, takes two arguments:
    1. The name of a log file the solution is to read
    2. The name of the output file the solution writes to

eg. python solution.py programming-task-example.data.log output.txt

The output file contains:
    1. The data and time the solution was run
    2. The name of the input file
    3. The number of unique IP addresses
    4. The top three active IP addresses
    5. The top three accessed URLs
